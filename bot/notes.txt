Main key:  64 bits.
56-bits are selected and permuted using Permuted Choice One (PC1); and then divided into two 28-bit halves.
In each round:
Left-rotate each half separately by either 1 or 2 bits according to a rotation schedule.

Select 24-bits from each half, and permute the combined 48 bits.  
This forms a round key.
